# Comment-Spider-for-SinaWeibo
Oct. 1st, 2018:
This project is released in July, 2018. Now I upload the main codes and data examples to this repo.
Later I would upload the detailed description.

------------
This is a spider for the comments of messages in Sina Weibo, and I'm still working on it :)

The basic framework is from Eastmount [http://blog.csdn.net/eastmount/article/details/51231852].

Now I've finished the data collecting work, and then I shall add some context analysis job to this project.
Thank you for watching!
